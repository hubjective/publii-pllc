I have a Master’s Degree in Nursing and additional certification to function as a nurse practitioner.  I am able to treat across the lifespan but limit my current practice to clients age 18 and older.</p><p>My practice is considered a general psychiatric nursing practice, which means I work with clients struggling with most psychiatric disorders.  I commonly treat mood disorders like depression and bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. Additionally, I am comfortable working with clients facing post-traumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, substance use disorders, and eating disorders. I can also provide sessions in Ericksonian Solution Oriented Hypnotherapy.</p><p>I will approach every interaction with you as a privilege and honor to be invited to a vulnerable moment in your life. I will respect you for the life story you bring to our work together and I view my role as a partner in your care. Together we will determine goals of treatment and problem solve a pathway to improved health.</p><p>On a more personal note, I moved to Asheville from the Midwest in mid 2015. I was born in Pennsylvania but moved to Ohio in my early childhood. In my adult life, I moved to the Metro Detroit area and resided in Michigan until moving to Asheville with my husband and two fur babies (my dogs Morty and Frank). My undergraduate training was through Malone University and my graduate training was at Wayne State University. I continue my education through participation in the American Psychiatric Nurses Association as well as various conferences and continuing education opportunities. I am also a member of Sigma Theta Tau an academic honor society.</p><p>My true love in nursing has always been in psychiatry.  I’ve worked as an inpatient psychiatric nurse with pediatric, adolescent, adult, and geriatric populations.  But I’ve also worked as a nurse case manager, nurse manager, and corporate trainer and bring knowledge from those careers as well.  I can’t imagine a more fulfilling profession than what I’m doing now and know this is where I am supposed to be in my career and service work in life.</p><p>I also want to take a moment to introduce to you my office manager. Rob Horn has been a life partner for many years now and he’s helping me by taking care of the front office work, so I have more time to devote to my patients. Rob excels in customer service, precision, documentation and at times, keeping my practice on track. When you call to schedule an appointment, reschedule an appointment, leave a message or just ask a question, Rob will likely be your first contact. He has the utmost respect for privacy and will always protect your confidentiality. He can field many questions upfront, and doesn’t hesitate to let me know when something needs my medical attention. He will be sensitive to your needs and always respectful!</p><p>Please don’t hesitate to reach out and contact me with additional questions you may have about my practice.</p></div></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer-container"><img src="media/files/inclusivity-badge.png" alt="Inclusive and Welcoming Practice Badge"><a href="https://www.mocatest.org/"><img src="media/files/Moca-Badge-150x150.png" alt="MoCA Certified Rater Badge"></a><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/profile/293471" class="sx-verified-seal"></a><script type="text/javascript" src="https://member.psychologytoday.com/verified-seal.js" data-badge="14" data-id="293471" data-code="aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHN5Y2hvbG9neXRvZGF5LmNvbS9hcGkvdmVyaWZpZWQtc2VhbC9zZWFscy9bQkFER0VdL3Byb2ZpbGUvW1BST0ZJTEVfSURdP2NhbGxiYWNrPXN4Y2FsbGJhY2s="></script></div><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://leeannehorn.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://leeannehorn.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
